    <p class="about"><br>
        "Memory game" is a thinking game, the goal is to match pairs of cards using your memory.<br>
        In this game there are about 12 cards, consisting of identical pairs of pictures, with the picture facing down.<br>
        Each time you click on one of the cards an image will appear, then you will have to look for a card with the same image.<br>
        The goal is to find two identical cards.<br>
        At the beginning of the game, you will probably have trouble finding two identical cards, 
        but as the number of attempts increases, the more you remember the pictures of the cards and their location.<br>
    </p><br>
    <b>Note:</b><br>If you do not choose any card for 30 seconds the game will stop!
